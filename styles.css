    Everything on a web page has a selector:
    - the tag (body, div, p, etc)
    - the class (.container)
    - the id (#main)
    the rules you write within the {} only effect that selector.

    You can use Inspect Element to find out what an element's
    tag, ID or class is. */

The '*' selector applies to all elements.
When combined with !important, it is extremely powerful.
Be careful...
